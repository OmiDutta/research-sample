Abstract: This study conducts a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis to evaluate stent performance in arterial aneurysms, focusing on the impact of Newtonian vs. non-Newtonian blood flow models, and stent 
design. The parameters which are used for the comparison are: pressure, velocity, wall shear stress and flow diversion. Simulations are done by using ANSYS FLUENT. There are three cases which are considered in this 
study: (i) Aneurysm without stent (ii) Aneurysm with a regular stent (iii)Aneurysm with a flow-diverter stent
